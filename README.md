3. (2 pts) Write a complete program in a cpp file that prompts the user to enter a number of
seconds.
● There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of seconds entered by the user is
greater than or equal to 60, the program should also display the number of
minutes.
● There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of seconds entered by the user
is greater than or equal to 3,600, the program should also display the number of
hours.
● There are 86,400 seconds in a day. If the number of seconds entered by the user is
greater than or equal to 86,400, the program should also display the number of
days
Sample output:
100000 seconds is equivalent to 1 day, 3 hours, 46
minutes, and 40 seconds.

5. (2 pts) Write a complete program in a cpp file that prompts the user to enter a year. The
program should then display a message informing the user if that year is a leap year. Use
the following criteria to identify leap years:
1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and
only if it is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not.
2. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible
by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.
Sample input and output:
Enter a year: 2008 [Enter]
2008 is a leap year.
